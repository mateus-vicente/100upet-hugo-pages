The configuration format is described in detail in Section 4.3. It consists of several section headers within [ and ] brackets, and a section without header at the start. Each of these sections contains a set of key/value pairs separated by the = character. Comments are indicated using the hash symbol (#).\nThe framework has the following three required layers of configuration files:\nThe main configuration: The most important configuration file and the file that is passed directly to the binary. Contains both the global framework configuration and the list of modules to instantiate together with their configuration. An example can be found in the repository at examples/example.conf. More details and a more thorough example are found in Section 3.2, several advanced simulation chain configurations are presented in Chapter 8.\nThe geometry configuration: It is passed to the framework to determine the detector setup and passive materials. Describes the detector setup, containing the position, orientation and model type of all detectors. Optionally, passive materials can be added to this configuration. Examples are available in the repository at examples/ example_detector.conf or examples/example_detector_passive.conf. Introduced in Section 3.3.\nThe detector model configuration: Contains the parameters describing a particular type of detector. Several models are already provided by the framework, but new types of detectors can easily be added. See models/test.conf in the repository for an example. Please refer to Section 9.5 for more details about adding new models.\nParsing Types and Units The Allpix Squared framework supports the use of a variety of types for all configuration values. The module specifies how the value type should be interpreted. An error will be raised if either the key is not specified in the configuration file, the conversion to the desired type is not possible, or if the given value is outside the domain of possible options. Please refer to the Chapter 7 for the list of module parameters and their types. Parsing the value roughly follows common-sense (more details can be found in Section 4.3). A few special rules do apply:\nIf the value is a string, it may be enclosed by a single pair of double quotation marks (\"), which are stripped before passing the value to the modules. If the string is not enclosed by quotation marks, all whitespace before and after the value is erased. If the value is an array of strings, the value is split at every whitespace or comma (,) that is not enclosed in quotation marks.\nIf the value is a boolean, either numerical (0, 1) or textual (false, true) representations are accepted.\nIf the value is a relative path, that path will be made absolute by adding the absolute path of the directory that contains the configuration file where the key is defined.\nIf the value is an arithmetic type, it may have a suffix indicating the unit. The list of base units is given in the table below.\nQuantity Default unit Auxiliary units Unity 1 - Length mm (millimeter) nm (nanometer), um (micrometer), cm (centimeter), dm (decimeter), m (meter), km (kilometer) Time ns (nanosecond) ps (picosecond), us (microsecond), ms (millisecond), s (second) Energy MeV (megaelectronvolt) eV (electronvolt), keV (kiloelectronvolt), GeV (gigaelectronvolt) Temperature K (kelvin) - Charge e (elementary charge) ke (kiloelectrons), fC (femtocoulomb), C (coulomb) Voltage MV (megavolt) V (volt), kV (kilovolt) Magnetic field strength T (tesla) mT (millitesla) Angle rad (radian) deg (degree), mrad (milliradian) Radiation fluence Neq (1-MeV neutron-equivalent) - Warning If no units are specified, values will always be interpreted in the base units of the framework. In some cases this can lead to unexpected results. E.g. specifying a bias voltage as bias_voltage = 50 results in an applied voltage of 50 MV. Therefore it is strongly recommended to always specify units in the configuration files. The internal base units of the framework are not chosen for user convenience but for maximum precision of the calculations and in order to avoid the necessity of conversions in the code.\nCombinations of base units can be specified by using the multiplication sign * and the division sign / that are parsed in linear order (thus $\\frac{V m}{s^2}$ should be specified as V*m/s/s). The framework assumes the default units if the unit is not explicitly specified. It is recommended to always specify the unit explicitly for all parameters that are not dimensionless as well as for angles.\nExamples of specifying key/values pairs of various types are given below:\n# All whitespace at the front and back is removed first_string = string_without_quotation # All whitespace within the quotation marks is preserved second_string = \" string with quotation marks \" # Keys are split on whitespace and commas string_array = \"first element\" \"second element\",\"third element\" # Elements of matrices with more than one dimension are separated # using square brackets string_matrix_3x3 = [[\"1\",\"0\",\"0\"], [\"0\",\"cos\",\"-sin\"], [\"0\",\"sin\",cos]] # If the matrix is of dimension 1xN, the outer brackets have to be # added explicitly integer_matrix_1x3 = [[10, 11, 12]] # Integer and floats can be specified in standard formats int_value = 42 float_value = 123.456e9 # Units can be passed to arithmetic types energy_value = 1.23MeV time_value = 42ns # Units are combined in linear order without grouping or implicit brackets acceleration_value = 1.0m/s/s # Thus the quantity below is the same as 1.0deg*kV*K/m/s random_quantity = 1.0deg*kV/m/s*K # Relative paths are expanded to absolute paths, e.g. the following value # will become \"/home/user/test\" if the configuration file is located # at \"/home/user\" output_path = \"test\" # Booleans can be represented in numerical or textual style my_switch = true my_other_switch = 0 ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The framework is configured with simple human-readable configuration …","ref":"/docs/03_detector_assembly/01_interconnection_qualification/","tags":"","title":"Configuration Files"},{"body":"The framework is configured with simple human-readable configuration files.

Each ASIC will have an Au stud bump on each bonding pad, placed using a wire-bonding machine. Each ASIC will be connected to the flex by flip-chip using Araldite 2011, meaning that the FPC bonding pads have the same layout as in the ASIC. Each FPC will host small 0201 SMD components in small regions close to the top and bottom peripheries of the 2x2 chip arrangement. The data lines and low-voltage power for the ASIC are routed via the a wide flex tail (to be connected to a rigid board hosting a ZIF connector), while the high-voltage for sensor biasing is routed via a thin flex tail with a dedicated HV connector (200 V, \u003c1 mA). The width of the flex is from 100 to 200 µm smaller than the width of the 2x2 chip arrangement, at least in the region of where the chips are placed to allow an external cooling block to mechanicaly be in contact with the lateral edges of the chips for cooling optimization.

While today small blood vessels can only be visualized in their entire, our technology will turn the invisible into visible, allowing the study of changes in the lining of small blood vessels, such as atherosclerotic plaques. The 100µPET is a project in the filed of ultra-high-resolution medical imaging, supported by a SNSF SINERGIA grant (CRSII5_198569, Period: June 1, 2021 - May 31, 2025). This project aims to pioneer ultra-high resolution molecular imaging and to make this technology available for novel cutting-edge medical applications. It aims to develop a prototype of an ultra-high resolution PET scanner for small animals in combination with advanced image reconstruction algorithms. The first step of this project is to perform, as the first biomedical application, ultra-high resolution molecular imaging of the onset and progression of atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice.\nThe ultra-high resolution scanner will use a multilayer of monolithic silicon pixel sensors as a detection medium. In contrast to conventional PET scanners, the concept of the 100µPET project uses photons that are converted inside 50 µm lead sheets. The electrons produced are detected and measured in highly accurate monolithic silicon sensors with a thickness of 100 µm. A stack of 60 lead+silicon detection layers ensures high efficiency with a peak sensitivity of 4%. The scanner's spatial granularity of 100×100×200 µm3 will provide unmatched spatial resolution and revolutionary depth of interaction measurements in high quality imaging. The scanner requires the development of advanced image reconstruction algorithms capable of exploiting the millions of detection channels. The main challenge for the reconstruction software will be to process the large amount of sensor data provided by the 100µPET scanner, to reduce measurement noise and to produce image reconstructions with the highest possible spatial resolution in a reasonable computing time. This will require taking advantage of the latest developments in image reconstruction technology, in particular the use of sophisticated regularization schemes and machine learning. These developments in instrumentation and software will overcome the current resolution limitation of PET scanners and open the field to ultra-high resolution molecular imaging. These advances will then and certainly quickly find new medical applications in very high precision imaging for humans.
