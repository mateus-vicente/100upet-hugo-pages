### Content related stuff that needs to be done

* Write feature text on landing page
* Improve sentence to download the PDF -> do we really want it bold though?
* Different backgroud image for screenshots and publications page
* Change EUTelescope Screenshots

### Stuff to do in the apsq repo

* Link to release downloads in `/releases` -> best to do in the documentaion
* New CI screenshot

### Some relatively simple technicalities

* Check if we need `canonifyURLs = true`
* Merge this branch into a testing branch, create commit for deploying testing branch w/ in test EOS subdir
* Make the CI work on tag push

### For the future:

* Document webEOS setup
* Add view this page source etc to `page-meta-link.html` partial that works for our setup
* Check for https://github.com/google/docsy/pull/987
* Full REUSE compliance
* Don't use Google Fonts (default is ugly though)
* Optional: wenn man eh schon includegraphics regex macht dann kann man doch gleich richtige latex figures machen
