Following [last year's successful participation](/blog/news/2018-08-23-gsoc-completed/) in Google's *Summer of Code* program, we have again proposed a project for students to work on through the High-Energy Physics Software Foundation (HSF). The organization has been accepted by Google, and the project description is now online available:

[Implement Event based Seeding and Multi-Threading](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/gsoc/2019/proposal_AllpixSquaredEventMultithreading.html)

The title is similar to the project of last year since we hope to address some of the issues discovered during the previous project. Please have a look at the project description and contact is in case you are interested to work on this.
