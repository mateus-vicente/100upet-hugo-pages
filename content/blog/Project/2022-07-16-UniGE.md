We are happy to announce the first stable and full-featured **Allpix Squared version 1.0**. It is available from the [repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/) as of now. The software is released under the MIT license, thus you are free to use it in whatever way you like.

Please go ahead, test the framework, implement your own simulations and report back your experience.

A few of the main physics features are:

* Full simulation of charge deposition with Geant4, encapsulated as a module of the framework
* Fast RKF5 charge carrier propagation using a drift-diffusion model
* Alternative propagation by projecting deposited charge carriers to sensor implants
* Output of produced ROOT objects in TTrees with full history, including the Monte Carlo truth information of every event
* Support for linear electric fields and TCAD-simulated field maps
* Conversion and import of electric fields from the TCAD DF-ISE format
