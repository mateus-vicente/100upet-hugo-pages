We are happy to announce the next patch release **Allpix Squared, version 1.6.2** which contains 70 commits over the previous patch version 1.6.1.
It fixes issues mostly related to the CI as well as some corner cases in a few modules.
This patch release contains patches from two new contributors - thank you and welcome!

The release is available as Docker image, CVMFS installation, binary tarball and source code from the [repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/).

The following issues have been resolved and improvements have been made:
<!--more-->

* **Continuous Integration:**
    * Versions compiled with Clang and for macOS are now also deployed to CVMFS and EOS for general use
    * A completely new CI workflow using GitHub Actions has been added to run a scaled-down CI for merge requests on [our GitHub mirror](https://github.com/allpix-squared/allpix-squared).
    * The addition of GitHub Actions required the adaptation and movement of some CI script files
    * The outdated and unused TravisCI configuration has been removed
* **Build system:**
    * Patterns in the Git ignore file has been improved
    * Our git hooks have been updated in order to check for the correct version when tagging
    * It is now possible to build against a Geant4 version with HDF5 support enabled
* **Module GeometryBuilderGeant4:**
    * New materials for support layers and passive elements are available: polystyrene and PPO foam
    * The material definition of cellulose has been corrected
* **Module DepositionReader:**
    * An issue with parsing strings obtained from ROOT has been addressed
    * An option to read events from file in non-sequential order has been added
* **Module VisualizationGeant4:** A workaround for an issue in log parsing in Geant4 10.07.p01 has been added
* **Module TransientPropagation:** A corner case issue has been fixed that would occur when using a 1x1 induction matrix with a 1x1 weighting potential. When charge carriers were crossing pixel boundaries, no negative induced current in the original pixel has been taken into account. See [MR!435](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/-/merge_requests/435) for more information.
* **Module ProjectionPropagation:** An issue with charge carriers deposited at the surface has been fixed.
* **Examples:** An additional ROOT analysis macro has been added as example and starting point for user analysis scripts.
