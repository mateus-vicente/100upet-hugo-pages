We would like to announce another patch release for a stable release of **Allpix Squared**. This is the third patch release of the 1.2 series, **version 1.2.3** and is rather small compared to previous patch releases. The reason for this is the ongoing preparation for the next feature release. As usual, the release is available from the [repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/) as of now.

The following changes have been incorporated:
<!--more-->

* **General:** Small improvements to the argument printout of the Allpix Squared executable. Several code simplifications suggested by `clang-tidy-8.0`.
* **Git / Build System:** Add new git pre-push hook to prevent creation of new tags without updating the version number in `CMakeLists.txt`.
* **Mesh Converter:** Correctly detector configuration file name form command line arguments. Allow dashes (`-`) in the validity region of the observable. Improve logging output.
* **Continuous Integration:** Use new `extends` feature of the GitLab CI to clean up the YAML file defining the CI jobs.
* **Manual:** Extension of the Frequently Asked Questions section, several typo corrections. Allow manual compilation with Pandoc versions 2.2.1 and newer.
