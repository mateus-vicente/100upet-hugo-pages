We are happy to announce the first patch release in the 2.0 series of **Allpix Squared, version 2.0.1**.
This release contains 26 commits over the major version 2.0.0 and fixes a few issues found over the past weeks.
The release is available as Docker image, CVMFS installation, binary tarball and source code from the [repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/).

The following issues have been resolved and improvements have been made:
<!--more-->

* **Custom Electric Fields:**
    * Solved a bug where custom electric fields were not scaled properly along the x/y axes
* **Module DepositionReader:**
    * Monte Carlo particles can now be provided in an arbitrary sequence while maintaining valid references to parent particles
    * The python script for creating deposition input files has been updated to generate several particles per event
* **Mesh Converter:**
    * The Mesh Converter now allows for defining the units of any observable to be read as a parameter as well as defining the dimensions of the observable
    * This enables a correct handling of units for doping profiles converted via this tool
* **Module CapacitiveTransfer:**
    * PixelHits in pixels within the coupling matrix are now only stored if the corresponding pixel contains charge
    * Minor cleanup of the module
