We are happy to announce the second patch release for **Allpix Squared version 1.0.2**, which is available from the [repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/).

The following changes have been incorporated:
<!--more-->

* **Module: GeometryBuilderGeant4** - solve bug which ignored the support layer material and defaulted to Epoxy. Now adds the specified material correctly. Also add new material "Lead"
* **Module: DetectorHistogrammer** - correct axis labels of histograms
* **Module: CorryvreckanWriter** - fix issue concerning ADC value and column/row assignment
* **Module: DefaultDigitizer** - add `nullptr` initialization for histograms and fill final charge plots in correct units. ADC smearing histogram is now only created when ADC simulation is used.
* **Module: LCIOWriter** - use `getOutputPath()` function to always store the output file in the correct location instead of the folder from which Allpix Squared is executed
* **Tools/ROOT macros** - allow missing output trees, fixes [#97](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/issues/97)
* **Core: path access** - throw `InvalidModuleAction` if path of output file is not accessible or writable
* **Core: file extensions** - dynamically add file extensions like `.root` so file names is configuration files can be given with or without extension
* **Manual:** fix a few typos, change layout of tables and unify the typesetting of framework parameters (bold and monospace font)
* **Build Tools:** correctly add the `CXX_FLAGS` from Geant4 - this fixes compilation issues with Geant4 multithreading enabled on Mac OS X platforms (see [#92](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/issues/92))
* **Continuous Integration:** update dependencies following the upgrade of the Mac CI machines to OS X High Sierra 10.13
