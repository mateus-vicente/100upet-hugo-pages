We are happy to announce the second patch release of the 1.1 series, **Allpix Squared version 1.1.2**. The release is available as

* Source code from the [repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/tags/v1.1.2)
* Binary tarballs for CERN CentOS7 and Scientific Linux CERN 6 from the [website](https://cern.ch/allpix-squared/releases/)
* As Docker image from the project's [Docker registry](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/container_registry)
* As directly usable [CVMFS installation](https://cern.ch/allpix-squared/usermanual/allpix-manualch10.html#x11-15500010.4.1) for LXPLUS machines or any other CERN machine.

This will likely be the last point release for the 1.1 series as exciting new features have already landed in the repository and call for a release of version 1.2 soon.

The following changes have been incorporated:
<!--more-->

* **Releases:** now Docker images are automatically produced and published for every new tag
* **Continuous Integration:** new feature for functionality tests: `#OPTION` allows to pass command-line options to test cases; improved handling of functionality tests in CMake; new tests for the file overwrite flag and some command-line options, target for Docker images
* **Manual:** Added description of Docker image usage and creation, fix some typos, better layout for warning boxes in HTML
* **Module: ROOTObjectWriter** - more clear error messages, appropriate exception thrown.
* **Core: Configuration** - now allows default Matrix to be given when using the `getMatrix<T>()` function; fixed bug where files with absolute paths were not checked for existence before usage.
* **Build system:** disable compiler warnings for ROOT-internals when creating ROOT dictionaries (`-Wno-inconsistent-missing-overwrite`)
* **Examples:** new example on how to replay a simulation by reading a data file using ROOTObjectReader
