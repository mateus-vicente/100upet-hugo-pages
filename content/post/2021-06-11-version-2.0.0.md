---

After more than 3.5 years of continuous development and countless feature and patch releases of the {{% allpix %}} 1.x series, we are proud to announce the second major release of the framework, **{{% allpix %}} 2.0**.
This version contains more than 1500 commits over the last feature release 1.6 and brings major improvements in many areas as detailed below.
Among them is a major rework of the framework core, introducing an efficient multithreading functionality including full reproducibility, as well as a large number of new features and physics simulation models.

As usual, the release is available as Docker image, CVMFS installation, binary tarball and source code from the [repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/).

We would like to use this opportunity for a few laudatory words.
* First of all, we would like to extend our gratitude to the by now 34 contributors and former developers as well as the countless users for their continued input to the development, be it through actual code or through fruitful discussions and suggestions on the implementation of different features.
* Furthermore, we would like to thank the two *Google Summer of Code* students, Viktor Sonesten and Mohamed Moanis Ali, who have contributed significantly to the new multithreading capabilities.
It took a while for your code to land in `master`, but here it is!
* Last but not least, we would like to thank Koen Wolters, one of the bedrocks of the {{% allpix %}} development who laid the foundation of the framework and until today - despite leaving the field and taking up a full-time job - continues to contribute code, to review merge requests and to make suggestions for improvements of the tool in his spare time. Thank you very much!

We would also like to advertise our [**second User Workshop**](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1043567/), which will be held fully virtually from 17 August 2021 to 19 August 2021.
Please register and submit an abstract to present your use case of {{% allpix %}}.

Enough of the chatter, let's cut to the new features shipped with {{% allpix %}} 2.0:

## Multithreading

The biggest new feature is arguably the availability of full, event-based multithreading.
With this, the simulation can make full use of all available CPU resources and can significantly speed up the simulation.
The feature has been initially developed by two *Google Summer of Code* students and has been completed with lots of rework in the first few months of 2021.
While the initial code was in place relatively quickly, quite some obstacles have been encountered on the way to a stable version.

### Event Parallelisation

In versions 1.x, {{% allpix %}} already had the option to process the multiple module instances for different detectors but for the same module in parallel.
While this was a very simple thing to implement, it does not scale very well due to multiple reasons.
First of all, the usage of threads is always limited by the number of detectors in the simulation, limiting the simulation to a fully single-thread execution for simulations of individual detectors.
Furthermore, detector modules which could be processed in parallel would be interleaved with unique modules that required a synchronous execution, and finally, individual module processing would be limited by the slowest detector instance.

To overcome these limitations, the parallelism architecture has been completely re-thought and re-written to follow the popular notion of event-based multithreading that is particularly useful in Monte Carlo simulations where events - by definition - represent fully independent entities.
With the new architecture, a central thread pool coordinates the assignment of events to different worker threads, and all module instances within one event are processed sequentially by the assigned worker.
This allows to scale linearly with the number of workers available on the system.

### Event-based Seeding

One of the corner stones of Monte Carlo simulations is reproducibility.
Also with multithreading, {{% allpix %}} guarantees strong reproducibility, meaning that a simulation can be fully reproduced when starting the program with the same configuration and the same starting seeds for the pseudo-random number generation.
Especially in multithreaded environments, this places stringent requirements on the internal workings of the code base and the way, seeds are distributed and random numbers are used by the different parts.
A common approach, also implemented in {{% allpix %}} is event-based seeding.
For this, every event receives a seed from a central pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) upon its creation. This seed subsequently is used to set the initial state of a PRNG to be used throughout the lifetime of this event.
In order to keep the memory footprint as low as possible, {{% allpix %}} does not allocate these PRNGs per event, but only per worker thread and seeds them whenever a new event is processed on the respective thread.
In order to allow interruption of event processing and resumption at a later point in time, the state of the PRNG is stored whenever the event processing is halted, e.g. for buffering as described below, and is loaded again when the event is restarted.

### Input/Output Module and Event Sequence

In order to create fully bit-compatible output files and to guarantee the same input to the simulation, matched to the same event seeds, some modules require to process events in their predefined sequence.
This means the framework core has to take care of distributing workload accordingly and to buffer events which are not due for processing in the relevant modules, and to avoid data races.
{{% allpix %}} provides a new class of modules, dubbed `SequentialModule`, for this purpose.
Modules deriving from this class have the guarantee to receive events for processing in their natural sequence.
The central thread pool holds a priority queue for partially processed events which are waiting to be further processed by a sequential module.
This allows to temporarily buffer these events such that the workers can occupy themselves with another event, leading to a very efficient usage of available resources.
An almost linear increase in event generation frequency with the number of worker threads has been observed for up to the tested maximum of 96 CPU cores that were available, despite the presence of SequentialModules in the simulation chain.

{{< figure src="/img/rate.png" caption="Event generation rate as function of used worker threads for a reference simulation" >}}

Sequential modules can waive the sequence requirement at run time if they have been configured in a way that strict order in event processing is not required by the user.

### Interface to Geant4

The run managers provided by the Geant4 framework for multithreaded simulations start and manage their own threads, a solution that does not integrate with the {{% allpix %}} framework.
It was therefore necessary to write our own implementation of run managers, both for single- and multithreaded execution of the simulation in order to be able to control the worker threads, but also to re-seed the Geant4 pseudo-random number generators with the event seeds obtained from the {{% allpix %}} core.
In the end, the solution implemented is quite sleek and has less overhead than the initial Geant4 interface used up to version 1.6.2.

Over the course of these renovations, we have also overhauled the way Geant4's informational messages and error codes are transmitted and displayed.
It is now possible to redirect the Geant4 output to any level of the {{% allpix %}} logger and therefore to properly see and log e.g. exceptions from problematic events generated.
This can be done by setting the relevant configuration keys in the `GeometryBuilderGeant4` module:

```toml
[GeometryBuilderGeant4]
# Target logging level for Geant4 messages from the G4cerr (error) stream:
log_level_g4cerr = WARNING
# Target logging level for Geant4 messages from the G4cout stream:
log_level_g4cout = TRACE
```


## Charge Carrier Recombination & Lifetime {#lifetime}

In many scenarios the finite lifetime of electrons and holes generated by the incident radiation in the silicon lattice is relevant, e.g. because of low electric field regions and high doping concentrations.
In order to simulate the recombination of these charge carriers properly, all available propagation modules, `GenericPropagation`, `ProjectionPropagation` and `TransientPropagation` have been fitted with the functionality of charge carrier recombination.
The lifetime of any charge carrier is derived from the position-dependent doping concentration of the sensor and calculated from one of the different lifetime models selectable via the configuration

Three models have been implemented and validated with a simulation of monolithic sensor implemented in a commercial CMOS imaging technology, namely the Shockley-Read-Hall model, the Auger model, which applies to minority charge carriers only, and a combination of the two.
At every step of the charge carrier propagation, the exponentially decreasing survival probability of a charge carrier is evaluated by comparing the duration of the time step to the lifetime provided by the above mentioned models.

The required effective doping concentration in the sensor is provided through a new module called `DopingProfileReader`, allowing the user to define a position dependent concentration throghout the sensor.
The doping profile can be provided in three ways:

* A constant doping concentration can be defined for the entire sensor volume.
* Several regions of different doping concentrations can be defined via a segmentation along the sensor depth.
* A three-dimensional scalar map can be parsed from files in the `APF` or `INIT` formats, the same formats already used by the electric field and the weighting potential maps.

The models are implemented as separate classes to avoid duplication of code and to allow for a more coherent use of these models throughout the codebase.
The individual models can be enabled via a parameter in the corresponding configuration section.


## Selecting the Charge Carrier Mobility Model {#mobility}

In previous versions, the charge carrier mobility used by {{% allpix %}} for the signal formation was fixed to the implemented Jacoboni-Canali model.
For the new release, additional models as well as the option to configure the mobility model from the configuration file have been added.

{{% allpix %}} now provides the following mobility models:
* **Jacoboni-Canali** model: https://doi.org/10.1016/0038-1101(77)90054-5, the only model available in {{% allpix %}}) 1.x
* **Canali** model: https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1975.18267, same as above, differs only in the electron saturation velocity
* **Hamburg** model: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2015.07.057, mobility parametrization for <100> silicon
* **Hamburg high-field** model: same as above but optimized for electric field strengths of above 2.5 kV/cm.
* **Masetti** model: https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1983.21207, doping concentration dependent mobility parametrization
* **extended Canali** model: combination of the Masetti and Canali models to obtain both doping dependence and saturation velocity
* **Arora** model: https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1983.21207, doping concentration dependent model

A detailed description of the different models, their validity range and the parameters chosen is provided in the user manual.
The desired mobility model can be selected from within the charge carrier propagation module configuration, while the previously used Jacoboni-Canali model remains the default option.
More models can be added upon request.

Similar to the lifetime models, also the mobility models are provided centrally and can be selected via the corresponding module configurations.

## Other Notable to the Framework Core

### New C++ Standard Requirement: C++17

The minimum supported C++ standard has been increased from `C++14` to `C++17`.
This allows us to use more modern features such the file system access functionality introduced with `C++17` or the possibility to use structured bindings.
This means, the minimum compiler requirements have been adapted accordingly, and now at least GCC 8.0, LLVM 7.0 pr AppleClang 12.0 are required.

### Boost Random Number Generator

We have struggled for a long time with cross-platform reproducibility of simulations due to the lax requirements on random number distributions imposed by the C++ Standard.
As one piece of the puzzle for full reproducibility of simulations, the C++ STL random number distributions were therefore replaced by the implementation provided by the Boost.Random library.
This implementation is platform independent and also allows users to run testing locally on their machines.

This implicates a dependency of {{% allpix %}} on Boost.Random with a version of at least 1.64, which is available for all common platforms.

### Unused Configuration Keys

With an increasing number of available configuration keywords and modules in a typical simulation pipeline, sometimes typos go unspotted, spoiling the expected simulation result.
To counteract this, the user is now made aware of unused configuration keys via `WARNING` log messages at the end of the simulation run, hinting at unintended configuration scenarios or potential typos in the main configuration file:

```
 (STATUS) Finished run of 1 events
 (STATUS) Finalization completed
(WARNING) Unused configuration keys in section ElectricFieldReader:mydetector:
          unused_key
 (STATUS) Executed 1 instantiations in 0 seconds, spending 0% of time in slowest instantiation ElectricFieldReader:mydetector
   (INFO)  Module ElectricFieldReader:mydetector took 0.000701816 seconds
```


### Introducing `enum` reflection for module configuration parameters

Many parameters involve selection of models from a list of implementations.
In {{% allpix %}} 1.x, this selection was usually made via string comparison and if-else clauses, selecting the correct value.
With models often being listed in `enum`s, we have introduced Enum reflection to allow direct parsing of configuration values to enums.

This changes a code such as:
```cpp
auto model = config_.get<std::string>("model");
std::transform(model.begin(), model.end(), model.begin(), ::tolower);
if(model == "a") {
    model_ = MyModel::A;
} else if(model == "b") {
    model_ = MyModel::B;
} else {
    throw InvalidValueError(config_, "model", "Invalid model, only 'a' and 'b' are supported.");
}
```

to a much shorter and more concise snippet:
```cpp
model_ = config_.get<MyModel>("model");
```

In case an invalid model (i.e. one that is not contained n the `enum`) is selected, an exception is thrown, stating all possible options and therefore replicating the behavior of the manually created exception from the example above:

```
  (FATAL) [C:MyModule:mydetector] Error in the configuration:
                                  Could not convert value 'c' from key 'model' in section 'MyModule' to type MyModule::MyModel: invalid value, possible values are: a, b
                                  The configuration needs to be updated. Cannot continue.
```


## Analytic Electric Fields

More complex, analytic electric fields can be defined by the module `ElectricFieldReader`.
In addition to the three-dimensional map and the analytic linear and constant electric field profiles, the user can now choose a parabolic parametrisation, as well as provide a custom analytic parametrisation.
The latter features either one- or three-dimensional electric field vectors provided in ROOT's TF1 syntax.

## Front-End saturation in `DefaultDigitizer`

A very simple front-end saturation simulation has been added to the `DefaultDigitizer`.

With this feature enabled, pixel charge values above a configurable saturation limit are replaced by a value drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean at the saturation limit and a configurable width.

## Continuous Integration

### Testing

The module test configurations have been moved into the respective module directories, which should provide a better overview over which module an individual test is probing.

In addition, tests do now fail in case of `WARNING`, `ERROR` or `FATAL` log messages.

### Linting & Formatting for `CMake`

Formatting rules have been introduced for `CMake` files.
Corresponding tests are performed as part of the Continuous Integration.

Several materials were added to the dictionary, including PPO foam and Polystyrene.
Furthermore, it is now possible to request any material known to the Geant4 NIST material manager.
