Summer has passed and we are happy to announce another patch release for the 2.0 series of **{{% allpix %}}, version 2.0.2**.
This release contains 40 commits over the last patch version 2.0.1 and fixes a few issues and smooths out a few missing code documentations.
The release is available as Docker image, CVMFS installation, binary tarball and source code from the [repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/).

The following issues have been resolved and improvements have been made:
<!--more-->

* **Module WeightingPotentialReader:** The scale of the loaded field maps is now provided as fraction of the pixel pitch, fixing an issue with mapping the field to pixels.
* **Module DepositionGeant4:**
   * Custom ions can now be configured to decay immediately via the additional decay parameter in their definition: `particle_type = "ion/Z/A/Q/E/D"`. The old definition is still supported.
   * New module tests have been added
* **Module CapacitiveTransfer:**
   * An issue in setting the affected matrix columns and rows in the `coupling_matrix` mode has been fixed
   * Module tests have been added
* **MeshConverter & MeshPlotter:**
   * The MeshPlotter tool is now capable of plotting scalar fields
   * A binning issue of histograms generated in the MeshPlotter has been solved
   * The Readme of the MeshConverter now reflects all available command line options
* **Doxygen Code Documentation:**
   * Some issues in the code documentation, such as outdated or missing parameters of methods, have been fixed
   * The CI now checks for correct documentation of all methods
* **Continuous Integration:**
   * The GitHub Actions CI now also features the `clang-tidy` linter, same as on GitLab.
   * Many new tests for the core portion of the framework have been added
* **Misc:**
   * All Python scripts in the repository have been ported to Python3
   * The `PixelCharge` object now also provides direct access to primary `MCParticle` objects via the `getPrimaryMCParticles()` method.
   * Fix division by zero in the field parser tool in case a loaded field has less than 100 vertices
