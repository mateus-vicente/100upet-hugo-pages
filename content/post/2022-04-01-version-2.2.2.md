We would like to announce the second patch release for the 2.2 series of **{{% allpix %}}, version 2.2.2**.
This release contains 18 commits over the previous patch release version 2.2.1.
The release is available as Docker image, CVMFS installation, binary tarball and source code from the [repository](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/).

The following issues have been resolved and improvements have been made:
<!--more-->

* **Core**
   * A possible deadlock/race condition in the thread pool has been fixed, which could lead to a hanging of the simulation when finalizing. We are not aware of issues with this "in the wild". Now the workers and the work queue are properly synchronized. [MR!707](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/-/merge_requests/707)
   * An issue in the generation of ROOT dictionaries lead to problems on installations where the source headers were not present. This was not an actual problem for the simulation or the data, but inspection of the written {{% allpix %}} objects was limited on that machine. [MR!724](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/-/merge_requests/724)
   * The Docker image now provide the installation of {{% allpix %}} in the directory `/usr/local` instead of `/opt/allpix-squared` and all required data files such as the Cosmic Ray reference data for *DepositionCosmics* are correctly installed. [MR!730](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/-/merge_requests/730)
* **Module GeometryBuilderGeant4:** An issue in the enumeration of GDML objects read from files as passive volumes prevented the correct addition of all defined objects to the simulation. This has been discovered after a report [in the forums](https://allpix-squared-forum.web.cern.ch/t/geometrybuildergeant4-module-passive-volumes-in-gdml-question-issue/275) and has been fixed. [MR!726](https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared/-/merge_requests/726)
