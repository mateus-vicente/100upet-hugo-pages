title: "Passing Objects using Messages"

Communication between modules is performed by the exchange of messages. Messages are templated instantiations of the
`Message` class carrying a vector of objects. The list of objects available in the Allpix Squared objects library is given in
[Section 6.1](../../06_objects/01_object_types). The messaging system has a dispatching mechanism to send messages and a
receiving part that fetches incoming messages. Messages are always received by modules in the order they have been dispatched
by preceding modules.

The dispatching module can specify an optional name for the messages, but modules should normally not specify this name
directly. If the name is not given (or equal to `-`) the `output` parameter of the module is used to determine the name of
the message, defaulting to an empty string. Dispatching messages to their receivers is then performed following these rules:

1.  The receiving module will *only* receive a message if it has the exact same type as the message dispatched (thus carrying
    the same objects). If the receiver is however listening to the `BaseMessage` type which does not specify the type of
    objects it is carrying, it will instead receive all dispatched messages.

2.  The receiving module will *only* receive messages with the exact name it is listening for. The module uses the `input`
    parameter to determine which message names it should listen for; if the `input` parameter is equal to `*` the module will
    listen to all messages. Each module by default listens to messages with no name specified (thus receiving the messages of
    dispatching modules without output name specified).

3.  If the receiving module is a detector module, it will *only* receive messages bound to that specific detector *or*
    messages that are not bound to any detector.

An example of how to dispatch a message containing an array of `Object` types bound to a detector named `dut` is provided
below. As usual, the message is dispatched at the end of the `run()` function of the module.

```cpp
void run(Event* event) {
    std::vector<Object> data;
    // ..fill the data vector with objects ...

    // The message is dispatched only for the module's detector, stored in "detector_"
    auto message = std::make_shared<Message<Object>>(data, detector_);

    // Send the message using the Messenger object for the given event
    messenger->dispatchMessage(this, message, event);
}
```

## Methods to process messages

The message system has multiple methods to process received messages. The first two are the most common methods and the third
should be avoided in almost every instance.

1.  Bind a **single message** to the input of this module. This should usually be the preferred method, where a module
    expects only a single message to arrive per event containing the list of all relevant objects. The following example
    binds to a message containing an array of objects and is placed in the constructor of a detector-type `TestModule`:

    ```cpp
    TestModule(Configuration&, Messenger* messenger, std::shared_ptr<Detector>) {
        // Subscribe to a single message, with no special messenger flags
        messenger->bindSingle<ExampleMessage>(this, MsgFlags::NONE);
    }
    ```

2.  Bind a **set of messages** to the input of the module. This method should be used if the module can (and expects to)
    receive the same message multiple times (possibly because it wants to receive the same type of message for all
    detectors). An example to bind multiple messages containing an array of objects in the constructor of a unique-type
    `TestModule` would be:

    ```cpp
    TestModule(Configuration&, Messenger* messenger, GeometryManager* geo_manager) {
        // Subscribe to multiple messages, with no special messenger flags
        messenger->bindMulti<Message<Object>>(this, MsgFlags::NONE);
    }
    ```

3.  Listen to a particular message type and execute a **filter function** as soon as an object is received. This can be used
    for more advanced strategies of retrieving messages, but the other methods should be preferred whenever possible. The
    listening module should *not* do any heavy work in the filtering function as this is supposed to take place in the module
    `run` method instead. The filter function should return a boolean, indicating whether the message is wanted or not. Using
    a filter function can lead to unexpected behavior because the function is executed during the run method of the
    dispatching module. This means that logging is performed at the level of the dispatching module and that the filter
    method can be accessed from multiple threads if the dispatching module is parallelized. Listening to a message containing
    an array of objects in a detector-specific `TestModule` could be performed as follows:

    ```cpp
    TestModule(Configuration&, Messenger* messenger, std::shared_ptr<Detector>) {
        messenger->registerFilter(this,
                                  /* Pointer to the filter method */
                                  &TestModule::filter,
                                  /* No special message flags */
                                  MsgFlags::NONE);
    }
    bool filter(std::shared_ptr<Message<Object>> message) const {
        // Decide if the message is wanted ...
    }
    ```

It should be noted that the `registerFilter` function by default adds the `IGNORE_NAME` message flag to receive all available
messages if called without the message flag parameter:

```cpp
messenger->registerFilter(this, &TestModule::filter);
```

This means that a possibly set `input` parameter of the respective module has no effect. If this behavior is undesired, the
filter should be registered explicitly stating the desired message flags or `MsgFlags::NONE`. The available message flags are
described in detail in the following section.

## Message flags

Flags can be added to the bind and listening methods which enable a particular behavior of the framework.

- `REQUIRED`:
  Specifies that this message is required during the event processing. If this particular message is not received before it
  is time to execute the module's run function, the execution of the method is automatically skipped by the framework for
  the current event. This can be used to ignore modules which cannot perform any action without received messages, for
  example charge carrier propagation without any deposited charge carriers.

- `ALLOW_OVERWRITE`:
  By default an exception is automatically raised if a single bound message is overwritten (thus receiving it multiple
  times instead of once). This flag prevents this behavior. It can only be used for variables bound to a single message.

- `IGNORE_NAME`:
  If this flag is specified, the name of the dispatched message is not considered. Thus, the `input` parameter is ignored
  and forced to the value `*`.

- `UNNAMED_ONLY`:
  If this flag is specified, the module will only receive messages without explicit name. The `input` parameter is ignored
  and forced to the value `?` and all named messages are discarded. It should be noted that `IGNORE_NAME` takes precedence
  over this parameter.

## Persistency

As objects may contain information relating to other objects, in particular for storing their corresponding Monte Carlo
history (see [Section 6.2](../../06_objects/02_object_history)), objects are by default persistent until the end of each
event. All messages are stored as shared pointers and are released at the end of each event. If no other copies of the shared
message pointer are created, then these will be subsequently deleted, including the objects stored therein. Where a module
requires access to data from a previous event (such as to simulate the effects of pile-up etc.), local copies of the data
objects must be created. Note that at the point of creating copies the corresponding history will be lost.
