The framework consists of the following four main components that together form Allpix Squared:

1.  **Core**:
    The core contains the internal logic to initialize the modules, provide the geometry, facilitate module communication and
    run the event sequence. The core keeps its dependencies to a minimum (it only relies on ROOT) and remains independent
    from the other components as far as possible. It is the main component discussed in this section.

2.  **Modules**:
    A module is a set of methods which is executed as part of the simulation chain. Modules are built as separate libraries
    and loaded dynamically on demand by the core. The available modules and their parameters are discussed in detail in
    [Chapter 7](../../07_modules).

3.  **Objects**:
    Objects form the data passed between modules using the message framework provided by the core. Modules can listen and
    bind to messages with objects they wish to receive. Messages are identified by the object type they are carrying, but can
    also be renamed to allow the direction of data to specific modules, facilitating more sophisticated simulation setups.
    Messages are intended to be read-only and a copy of the data should be made if a module wishes to change the data. All
    objects are compiled into a separate library which is automatically linked to every module. More information about the
    messaging system and the supported objects can be found in [Section 4.6](.././06_messages).

4.  **Physics**:
    In many cases, several modules depend on the same underlying physics models. These models are separated from the modules
    themselves. The implemented physics models are described in [Chapter 5](../../05_models).

5.  **Tools**:
    Allpix Squared provides a set of header-only 'tools' and a shared library that allow access to common logic shared by
    various modules. Examples are the Runge-Kutta solverÂ \[[@fehlberg]\] implemented using the Eigen3 library and the set of
    template specializations for ROOT and Geant4 configurations. More information about the tools can be found in
    [Chapter 13](../../13_additional). This set of tools is different from the set of core utilities the framework
    itself provides, which is part of the core and explained in [Section 4.8](.././08_logging).

Finally, Allpix Squared provides an executable which instantiates the core of the framework, receives and distributes the
configuration object and runs the simulation chain.

The chapter is structured as follows. [Section 4.2](.././02_core_architecture) provides an overview of the architectural
design of the core and describes its interaction with the rest of the Allpix Squared framework. The different subcomponents
such as configuration, modules and messages are discussed in thereafter. The chapter closes with a description of the
available framework tools in [Section 4.8](.././08_logging). Some C++ code will be provided in the text, but readers not
interested may skip the technical details.
