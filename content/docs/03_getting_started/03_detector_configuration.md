The detector configuration consists of a set of sections describing the detectors in the setup. Each section starts with a
header describing the name used to identify the detector; all names are required to be unique. Every detector has to contain
all of the following parameters:

- A string referring to the `type` of the detector model. The model should exist in the search path as described in
  [Section 4.5](../../04_framework/05_geometry_detectors#detector-models).

- The 3-dimensional `position` in the world frame in the order x, y, z. See
  [Section 4.5](../../04_framework/05_geometry_detectors) for details.

- The `orientation` specified as X-Y-Z extrinsic Euler angles. This means the detector is rotated first around the world's
  X-axis, then around the world's Y-axis and then around the world's Z-axis. Alternatively the orientation can be set as
  Z-Y-X or Z-X-Z extrinsic Euler angles, refer to section [Section 4.5](../../04_framework/05_geometry_detectors) for
  details.

In addition to these required parameters, the following parameters allow to randomly misalign the respective detector from
its initial position. The values are interpreted as width of a normal distribution centered around zero. In order to
reproduce misalignments, a fixed random seed for the framework core can be used as explained in
[Section 3.4](.././04_framework_parameters). Misalignment can be introduced both for shifts along the three global axes and
the three rotations angles with the following parameters:

- The parameter `alignment_precision_position` allows the specification of the alignment precision along the three global
  axes. Each value represents the Gaussian width with which the detector will be randomly misaligned along the
  corresponding axis.

- The parameter `alignment_precision_orientation` allows to specify the alignment precision in the three rotation angles
  defined by the `orientation` parameter. The misalignments are added to the individual angles before combining them into
  the final rotation as defined by the `orientation_mode` parameter.

The optional parameter `role` accepts the values `active` for detectors and `passive` for passive elements in the setup. If
no value is given, `active` is taken as the default value.

Furthermore it is possible to specify certain parameters of the detector, which is explained in more detail in
[Section 4.5](../../04_framework/05_geometry_detectors#detector-models). This allows to quickly adapt e.g. the sensor
thickness of a certain detector without altering the actual detector model file.

An example configuration file describing a setup with one CLICpix2 detector and two TimepixÂ \[[@timepix]\] models is the
following:

```ini
# Placement of first detector, named "telescope1"
[telescope1]
# Type to the detector is the "timepix" model
type = "timepix"
# Position the detector at the origin of the world frame
position = 0 0 0mm
# Default orientation: perpendicular to the incoming beam
orientation = 0 0 0

# Placement of the second detector, the "DUT (device under test)
[dut]
# Detector model is "clicpix2"
type = "clicpix2"
# Position is downstream of "telescope1":
position = 100um 100um 25mm
# Rotated by 20 degrees around the world x-axis
orientation = 20deg 0 0

# Third detector is downstream "telescope2"
[telescope2]
# Detector type again is "timepix"
type = "timepix"
# Placement 50 mm downstream of the first detector
position = 0 0 50mm
# Default orientation
orientation = 0 0 0
```

This configuration is used in the rest of this chapter for explaining concepts. A visualization of the setup is given below.

## Passive material configuration

Descriptions of passive materials can be added to the detector setup via a set of sections, with a syntax similar to the
detector configuration. Passive geometry entries are identified by the `role` parameter set to `passive`. Each section starts
with a header describing the name used to identify the passive material; all names are required to be unique.

Every passive material has to contain all of the following parameters:

- The `position` and `orientation` of the material as described for the detector, see
  [Section 3.3](.././03_detector_configuration).

- A string referring to the `type` of the passive material. The model should be interpreted by the module constructing the
  passive material, such as for example the
  [`GeometryBuilderGeant4` module](../../07_modules/geometrybuildergeant4#passive-volumes).

- A string referring to the `material` of the passive material. The materials for the `GeometryBuilderGeant4` module are
  defined in the [module documentation](../../07_modules/geometrybuildergeant4#materials).

- A set of size parameters specific for the model that is chosen. All size parameters that describe the total length of
  something are placed such that half of this total length extends from each side of the given `position`. If a parameter
  describes the radius, this means the radius will extend from the `position` on both sides, making its total size two
  times the radius in the given direction. The size parameters for the specific models in the `GeometryBuilderGeant4`
  module are described in the [module documentation](../../07_modules/geometrybuildergeant4#passive-volumes).

In addition, an optional string referring to the `mother_volume`, which defines another passive material the volume will be
placed in, can be specified.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
If a mother volume is chosen, the position defined in the configuration file will be relative to the center of the mother
volume. An error will be given if the specified mother volume is too small for the specified size or position of this volume.
Per default, the mother volume is the world frame.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
If the `mother_volume` is a hollow material, only the non-hollow part of the material is considered part of the material.
Placing a passive volume in the hollow part requires a different `mother_volume`.
{{% /alert %}}

Similar to the detector configuration, the parameters `orientation_mode` (see
[Section 4.5](../../04_framework/05_geometry_detectors)), `alignment_precision_position` and
`alignment_precision_orientation` (see [Section 3.3](.././03_detector_configuration)) can be used optionally to define the
rotation order and a possible misalignment of passive materials.

An example configuration file describing a set of passive materials with different configuration options is the following:
