The scanner prototype will use test-chips to validate the simultaneous bonding of multiple chips, the stacking of the layer modules, and the cooling performance.
Such test-chip will contain, in addition to a few chain segments for bonding cintinuity tests, it will also have a 4-wire probing points to measure the single bond resistance, and a spiral heater in the center of the chip, and a PT-XYZ-like temperature sensor.
