Allpix Squared provides the possibility to simulate finite lifetimes of charge carriers as a function of the local doping
concentration via non-radiative recombination processes. While most of these models require the *total doping concentration*
$`N_D + N_A`$ as parameter, the doping profile used throughout Allpix Squared provides the *effective doping concentration*
$`N_D - N_A`$ since this also encodes the majority charge carriers via its sign - an information relevant to some of the
models. However, in the parts of a silicon detector relevant for this simulation, i.e. the sensing volume, the difference
between effective and total concentration is expected to be negligible. Therefore the two values are treated as equivalent
throughout the lifetime models and the doping concentration is taken as the absolute value $`N = \left|N_D - N_A\right|`$.

Whether a charge carrier has recombined with the lattice is calculated for every step of the simulation using the relation

```math
p < 1 - e^{- dt / \tau(N)}
```

where $`p`$ is a recombination probability, drawn from a uniform distribution with $`[0, 1]`$, $`dt`$ is the last time step
of the charge carrier motion and $`\tau`$ the lifetime for the local doping concentration calculated by the models described
in the following. If the above equation evaluates to *false*, the charge carrier still exists, if it evaluates to *true* it
has been recombined with the lattice.

Finite charge carrier lifetime can be simulated by all propagation modules and comprise the following models:

## Shockley-Read-Hall Recombination

This model describes the finite lifetime based on Shockley-Read-Hall or trap-assisted recombination of charge carriers with
the lattice \[[@shockley-read], [@hall]\]. The lifetime is calculated using the Shockley-Read-Hall relation as given by
\[[@fossum-lee]\]:

```math
\tau(N) = \frac{\tau_0}{1 + \frac{N}{N_{d0}}}
```

where $`\tau_0`$ and $`N_{d0}`$ are reference lifetime and doping concentration, for electrons and holes respectively. The
parameter values implemented in Allpix Squared are taken from \[[@fossum-lee]\] and the Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD software
manual as

```math
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{0,e} &=  1\times 10^{-5} \,\text{s} \\
N_{d0,e}   &=  1\times 10^{16} \,\text{cm}^{-3} \\
\\
\tau_{0,h} &= 4.0\times 10^{-4} \,\text{s} \\
N_{d0,h}   &= 7.1\times 10^{15} \,\text{cm}^{-3}
\end{aligned}
```

for electrons and holes, respectively.

The temperature dependence of the Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime is scaled following the low-temperature approximation model
presented \[[@schenk]\] as:

```math
\tau(N, T) = \tau(N) \cdot \left( \frac{300 \,\text{K}}{T} \right)^{3/2}
```

This model can be selected in the configuration file via the parameter `recombination_model = "srh"`.

## Auger Recombination

At high doping levels exceeding $`5\times 10^{18} \,\text{cm}^{-3}`$ \[[@fossum-lee]\], the Auger recombination model becomes
increasingly important. It assumes that the excess energy created by electron-hole recombinations is transferred to another
electron (*e-e-h process*) or another hole (*e-h-h process*). The total recombination rate is then given by \[[@kerr]\]:

```math
R_{Auger} = C_n n^2p + C_p n p^2
```

where $`C_n`$ and $`C_p`$ are the Auger coefficients. The first term corresponds to the e-e-h process and the second term to
the e-h-h process. In highly-doped silicon, the Auger lifetime for minority charge carriers can be written as:

```math
\tau(N) = \frac{1}{C_{a} \cdot N^2}
```

where $`C_{a} = C_{n} + C_{p}`$ is the ambipolar Auger coefficient, taken as
$`C_{a} = 3.8\times 10^{-31} \,\text{cm}^6\,\text{s}^{-1}`$ from \[[@dziewior]\].

This recombination mode applies to minority charge carriers only, majority charge carriers have an infinite life time under
this model and the recombination equation will always evaluate to *true*.

This model can be selected in the configuration file via the parameter `recombination_model = "auger"`.

## Combined SRH/Auger Recombination

This model combines the charge carrier recombination from the Shockley-Read-Hall and the Auger model by inversely summing the
individual lifetimes calculated by the models via

```math
\begin{aligned}
\tau^{-1}(N) &= \tau_{srh}^{-1}(N) + \tau_{a}^{-1}(N) &\quad \text{for minority charge carriers} \\
             &= \tau_{srh}^{-1}(N)                    &\quad \text{for majority charge carriers}
\end{aligned}
```

where $`\tau_{srh}(N)`$ is the Shockley-Read-Hall and $`\tau_{a}(N)`$ the Auger lifetime. The latter is only taken into
account for minority charge carriers.

This model can be selected in the configuration file via the parameter `recombination_model = "srh_auger"`.

## Recombination with Constant Lifetimes

Some materials require constant lifetimes for charge carriers $`\tau(N) = \tau`$. This model requires the additional
configuration keys `lifetime_electron` and `lifetime_hole` to be present in the module configuration section, for example:

```ini
# Constant lifetimes for electrons and holes in GaAs with Cr compensation:
recombination_model = "constant"
lifetime_electron = 30ns
lifetime_hole = 4.5ns
```

This model can be selected in the configuration file via the parameter `recombination_model = "constant"`.
