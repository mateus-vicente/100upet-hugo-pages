The size of the final (diced) 100µPET chip, will depend on the dicing technique used.</br>
The chip dimension is **22787.8 µm x 30186 µm**. </br>
The gap between neighbouring chips is **240 µm**. </br>
The dicing will happen in the midle of such gap, therefore there is extra 120 µm of silicon on each of the four edges of the chip, summing up to **23027.8 µm x 30426 µm**.

If, for example, 100 µm of silicon are removed during the dicing, the final dimension of the chip to be bonded will be 29927.8 µm x 30326 µm. </br>
When using the Femto second laser WS-Turret MM200-USP (a Carbide CB5 femto laser source with maximum output power of 6W and tunable pulse duration between 290 fs and 20 ps and 1 μm stage resolution), available at FCBG-NMP, the amount of silicon removed was < 50 µm with no visible change (i.e. up to 10 µm) along the diced edge. More is discussed in the assembly prototype section.
