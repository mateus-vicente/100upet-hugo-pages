The 100μPET project aims at the construction of a novel generation small-animal Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner, with unprecedented volumetric spatial resolution to perform ultra-high resolution molecular imaging of the onset and progression of atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice.
PET is the most sensitive imaging technique to register molecular interactions of specific bio-markers, biochemicals and pharmaceuticals, in an organism. The sensitivity to track these bio-markers, to their lowest concentrations, is achieved by the addition of specific positron-emitting radionuclides, which can be attached to the specific bio-markers without disturbing their biological function. These radio-labeled bio-markers can then be traced by the detection of the photons coming from the positron annihilation. PET imaging relies in detecting (within the shortest coincidence time-window possible) the two photons from the electron-positron annihilation, and reconstruct in
a 3D space the vertex position of the annihilation.
The advent of PET imaging has led to a deeper understanding of the development, progression, and treatment response for a
variety of major diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, and malignant neoplasms. While the advantage of PET is its unprecedented sensitivity to detect low molecular masses of the radiotracer, it’s weakness is its low resolution to image sub-millimeter features.
