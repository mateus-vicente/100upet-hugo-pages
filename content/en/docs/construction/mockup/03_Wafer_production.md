## Introdiction
The wafer production is splitted in two:
- 4-inch wafers with Pt RTDs and Al heaters, maskless, produced by FCBG at NMP
- 6-inch wafers with Al heaters, with Cr mask, produced by us at CMi.

## Inventory

### 6-inch
We have started with 23 wafers in total, from a batch of 25 (two got brokem at the supplier).
</br>
20 wafers were coated by the supplier with 100 Å ±10% / 10,000 Å ±10% Ti / Al (sputtered).
</br>
The list below is the wafer thickness measured by the supplier after coating.
</br>
The wafers were delivered on a cassette with the same order as the list below.

The following list shows the status of each wafer.
