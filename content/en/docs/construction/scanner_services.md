The scanner has a total of 960 chips. They are assembled in 240 modules (4 chips each) that are further grouped into double-layer modules (8 chips) via the TMI board.
- The ASIC has a 3-bit address. Is it worth to daisy-chain two layers and consider it one element for servicing?

## Specs **TODO**
- Total power (voltage and current levels)  needed for a double-layer module and full tower with 30 double-layer modules
    - Calculated amount of power supplies needed
- Estimate needed cooling power and performance for latest design
