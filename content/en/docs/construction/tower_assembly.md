The assembly of the scanner's tower consists in mounting the previously assembled layer modules into a stack.
60 layers will compose the tower, and such tower will be encapsulated by the cooling housing.

### Specs **TODO**
- Will consective modules, or the double-layer modules, have adhesive between? Are the layers replacable if needed?
    - This will add the adhesive thickness (x60) to the total height of the tower
